# Cookbooker
Hi,

This is a simple web-app developed with React/NodeJs on the frontend and MongoDB/ExpressJs on the backend. This was my first attempt at a full stack application and I learned alot about React, React Bootstrap, and CRUD operations!

I've thought about fixing this application up with what I know now, but have decided against it as keeping it as is gives me a sense aof validation on how far I've come since developing this.

Thank you for taking a look!

Best,

Robert
